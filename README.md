# CVHandModule
A small module to track the position of the hands. I used a PS3 eye camera to capture video, if you are running a 64 bit system you will need drivers for it https://github.com/jkevin/PS3EyeDirectShow/releases.
The module is based on MediaPipe https://google.github.io/mediapipe/ .
First of all, the module is designed to determine the coordinates of parts of the hand.
Some tips in code comments.

Here is a map.
